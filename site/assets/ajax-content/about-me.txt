About Me

<break>
Hello, I am Ujwol I am  a Web Programmer. I am  an experienced and passionate Full stack Web Developer. In addition to my Web Development skills, I also possess a great eye for front-end design and especially love the fun things ( especiallly animation ) one can do with HTML5, CSS,Javascript and jQuery these days ( like this text animation, Cool huh! ). I am highly skilled in  Javascript ,WordPress, PHP, jQuery HTML and CSS3 ( really like animations possible with  keyframes ), and just love the AJAX( ninja emoji~wish there was one ). I have over 10 years of experience with each of these technologies including MySQL, and I like to learn new  technologies and love to play with electronic gadgets. 
In addition to web technologies, I do have a passion for mobile technologies as well. I have programmed some Android application for personal purposes in the past and I am learning Swift programming in my spare time, hopefully you will get chance to use one of my iOS app soon and I can also write native app using electronjs. I used to program WordPress plugins, which I also have published on official WordPress plugin site. With more than 20,000 downloads and 1,000 active installation. I also wrote  lightweight WordPress e-commerce plugin written from scratch by myself.  I also have 7 repositories ( 5 active and 2 deprecated ) hosted on npmjs.com. However, I am moving away from PHP/WordPress, instead focusing on Javascript/CSS3 and learning NodeJS thsese days. As I do a lot of coding, doing so in different languages was getting a bit confusing at time. So I had to choose between Javascript/CSS and WordPress/PHP, so I chose Javascript, CSS3 for front-end and NodeJs for server side scripting.
